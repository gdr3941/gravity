** [2022-03-14 Mon 20:33] Gravity Over Accel
Another issue: at very small distances (sub radius), forces get really high
When then sign flips due to collision system, get crazy high accelerations
This is causing the "exploding" particles problem.
Fixed with check for distance < radius combined

** [2022-03-13 Sun 19:13] Perf Results
On linux, running around 8fps with 2000 rocks (12 on mac??)
Heaviest hit is Atan2 using about 40% of samples
SinCos is next highest @ 33 

Now running with fast @ 49 fps on mac @ 2000 rocks!
On desktop, running 59fps @ 2000 rocks!!

35 fps now on mac with hypot, switched back and back at 45 fps.
